Droidcon challenge
==

Add a unit test for the chance to win a **hudl2**!

Each day of droidcon we'll announce a repo that's in need of some test love, to enter the competition you will need to follow these rules :

1. Fork the repo on github.
2. Add **one** unique passing unit test to the **unit-tests** module.
3. Make a pull request against our repo on github (with your best gif)

**At the end of each day one winner will be chosen at random from the pull requests made that day**

Useful stuff:

- Follow **[@novoda](http://twitter.com/novoda)** to stay in the loop
- Using android-studio open the root build.gradle to import the project. Magic, no setup! *unless you're on windows*...
- Run the all the tests from the command line with `./gradlew test`

Merlin
======

####*"An ok name for a library"*


Merlin aims to simplify network monitoring by providing 3 registerable callbacks. 
`onConnect()` , `onDisconnect()` and `onBind(NetworkStatus networkStatus)`.

##Adding to your project##

If you're using gradle all you need is this : 

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile "com.novoda:merlin:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT"
}
``` 

####[if you're not using gradle yet... (maven and jar setup)](https://github.com/novoda/merlin/wiki/adding-via-jar-and-maven)####


##Usecases##

####`onConnect()`####

![](https://raw.github.com/novoda/merlin/master/releases/res/on_connect.jpg)

**When** the network state changes from disconnected to connected and a successful host ping has completed.

**Because** you have just aquired a valid network connection, time to update stale data!

####`onDisconnect()`####

![](https://raw.github.com/novoda/merlin/master/releases/res/on_disconnect.jpg)

**When** the network state changes from connected to disconnected.

**Because** you probably want to tell the user they're now offline! or disable certain functionality until a reliable connection is available again.

####`onBind(NetworkStatus networkStatus)`####

**When** the `MerlinService` has binded, the current `NetworkStatus` is provided, although this is without pinging a host. 

**Because** you may need to know the current state of the network before a network change occurs.

###`isConnected()`###

**When** you want to know the current network status, without performing a host ping.

**Because** you need to know if a network connection is available quickly.

##Simple usage

Create Merlin (using `Merlin.Builder()`)

```java
merlin = new Merlin.Builder().withConnectableCallbacks().build(context);
```

Bind and unbind the service in your activity

```java
@Override
protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    merlin.bind();
}

@Override
protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    merlin.unbind();
}
```

Register for callbacks

```java
merlin.registerConnectable(new Connectable() {
        @Override
        public void onConnect() {
            // Do something!
        }
});
```

Create MerlinsBeard

```java
merlinsBeard = MerlinsBeard.from(context);
```

Use MerlinsBeard to retrieve the current network state

```java
        if (merlinsBeard.isConnected()) {
            // Connected, do something!
        } else {
            // Disconnected, do something!
        }
```
    
The [`MerlinActivity`](https://github.com/novoda/merlin/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/novoda/merlin/demo/presentation/base/MerlinActivity.java) within the demo shows a simple way to declutter Merlin from your main application code.
